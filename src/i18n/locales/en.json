The trial includes our core features such as AI PinBot, chat customization, and survey tools.\n\nSome advanced features like third-party integrations (LINE, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram) and custom domains are not included in the trial. You can unlock them once you subscribe to a paid plan.",
        "q2": "What is MAU (Monthly Active Users)?",
        "a2": "MAU refers to the number of unique users who interact with your chat service within a calendar month. This includes visitors who send messages, participate in conversations, or engage with your AI PinBot. Each unique user is counted once per month, regardless of how many times they chat.",
        "q3": "How is pricing calculated?",
        "a3": "Plans are billed monthly based on your subscription tier. Each plan includes a fixed number of Monthly Active Users (MAU) and AI PinBot messages. If you need more than what's included, you can upgrade your plan or contact us for custom pricing.",
        "q4": "Will my plan renew automatically?",
        "a4": "Yes. All subscriptions renew automatically every month unless you cancel before your renewal date.",
        "q5": "Can I change my plan later?",
        "a5": "Yes. You can switch plans at any time. To upgrade or downgrade, simply cancel your current subscription and subscribe to a new plan. The process only takes a few clicks, and your data will remain intact.",
        "q6": "What happens if I exceed my usage limits?",
        "a6": "If you exceed your MAU or AI PinBot quota, your service will continue but some features (like AI PinBot replies) may pause until you upgrade your plan or contact us to arrange additional capacity.",
        "q7": "What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?",
        "a7": "Your data will remain stored for a limited period after cancellation. You can re-subscribe to regain access.",
        "q8": "Do you offer custom enterprise pricing?",
        "a8": "Yes. For larger teams or businesses with advanced needs, we provide custom plans with flexible features and dedicated support. Please contact us to learn more.",
